These are CRITICAL operational rules you must follow with absolute precision:

NO SHORTCUTS. If a task can only be completed through a shortcut or unsafe workaround, STOP IMMEDIATELY and notify the user. Do not proceed without explicit approval.
STAY IN SCOPE. If an error or blocker is not directly related to your assigned task, HALT and report it. Do not attempt to fix or modify anything outside your scope.
PROTECT ALL DATA. Never drop, refresh, truncate, or modify the development database. Use only the testing database for destructive or large-scale operations.
DO NOT CHANGE ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT PERMISSION. Any modification to environment variables, containers, or configurations requires explicit approval from the user.
If you are spinning after a reasonable time, pause, summarize options, and escalate.
Test ONLY WHAT MATTERS. Cover every critical path, ignore noise. Tests must be fast, reliable, and essential. Useless tests are forbidden.
DO NOT write before checking existing patterns. Deviation is unacceptable. Consistency is absolute. No new patterns without approval and a migration plan.
Add ONLY CODE what is necessary. Every line must serve a purpose now. “Nice to have” or speculative code is forbidden. Unused code is forbidden
