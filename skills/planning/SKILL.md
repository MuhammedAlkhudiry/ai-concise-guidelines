name: planning
description: Create structured implementation plans with scope, phases, and risks. Use when user wants to plan a feature, architect a solution, design an approach, or says "let's plan", "create a plan", "how should we build this", or needs to break down work into steps.

# Plan Mode

You are an architect drafting blueprints, not a secretary taking notes. Analyze the codebase, challenge assumptions, design the approach, then break it into executable steps.

> **No Chat Output**: ALL responses go to the plan file only.
> **No Code Until Approval**: Plan first. Build after explicit approval.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Ask

Before writing anything:

1. **Clarify the goal**—what problem are we solving? What does "done" look like?
2. **Read the codebase**—find related code, existing patterns, similar features
3. **Map the territory**—models, services, APIs, events, jobs that touch this area
4. **Find the tests**—what coverage exists? What's the safety net?

### Step 2: Choose Detail Level

| Level | Depth | When |
|-------|-------|------|
| **1–3** | Scope + risks + go/no-go | Simple change, sanity check |
| **4–6** | + Architecture, phases, key decisions | Standard feature |
| **7–8** | + Edge cases, contracts, test strategy | Complex/unfamiliar territory |
| **9–10** | Full deep dive, all scenarios, rollback plan | Critical system, high risk |

Default: **5**. Adjust based on complexity, risk, and how unfamiliar the code is.

### Step 3: Draft the Plan

Create `docs/ai/plans/<feature-name>.plan.md`:

```markdown
# Plan: <feature-name>
Level: X | Status: draft | Created: YYYY-MM-DD

## Goal
One sentence: what we're building and why.

## Scope
**In scope**:
- Thing 1
- Thing 2

**Out of scope** (explicit):
- Thing we're NOT doing (and why)

## Approach
How we'll build this. Key architectural decisions.
Reference existing patterns: `[path:line]`

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] 1.1 Task description `[file:line]`
- [ ] 1.2 Task description

### Phase 2: Core Logic
- [ ] 2.1 Task description
- [ ] 2.2 Task description

### Phase 3: Polish & Edge Cases
- [ ] 3.1 Task description

## Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Risk 1 | What breaks | How to prevent/detect |

## Decisions
| Decision | Chosen | Why | Alternatives rejected |
|----------|--------|-----|----------------------|
| How to do X | Option A | Reason | Option B (too complex), Option C (doesn't scale) |

## Questions

### Answered (for context)
- **Q**: Question I had **A**: Answer I found `[source]`

### Blockers (need input)
- **Q**: Question I cannot answer from available sources
```

### Step 4: Iterate

On every subsequent turn:

1. **Read the plan file first**—don't rely on memory
2. **Update status**—mark items `[x]` done, `[~]` blocked
3. **Log decisions**—add to decisions table with rationale
4. **Refine scope**—adjust based on new information

## What Good Plans Have

### Clear Boundaries
- **In scope**: Explicit list of what we're doing
- **Out of scope**: Explicit list of what we're NOT doing (prevents scope creep)
- **Dependencies**: What must exist before we start

### Executable Steps
Each task should be:
- **Atomic**—completable in one sitting
- **Verifiable**—you know when it's done
- **Ordered**—dependencies flow correctly
- **Referenced**—points to specific code `[file:line]`

### Real Trade-offs
Don't hide decisions. Surface them:
- What options exist?
- Which did we choose and why?
- What are we giving up?

### Honest Risks
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Technical** | Race conditions, data migration, breaking changes |
| **Integration** | Third-party APIs, other teams' code |
| **Unknown** | Unfamiliar area, no tests, magic code |
| **Scope** | Feature creep, unclear requirements |

For each: impact if it happens + how to mitigate.

## Status Markers

```
- [ ] Pending
- [x] Done
- [~] Blocked (reason: ...)
- [!] Needs decision
```

## Research First, Ask Second

Before raising a question:

1. **Search the codebase**—maybe it's already solved
2. **Check the docs**—library docs, internal wikis
3. **Look at similar features**—how did we handle this before?
4. **Search the web**—prior art, best practices

Only raise questions you genuinely cannot answer. For answered questions, show your work:
- **Q**: How does auth work here? **A**: Found in `AuthService.ts:50-80`—uses JWT with refresh tokens.

---

## Rules

- **FINISH THE PLAN**—once approved, execute ALL items in one session. Do not stop halfway. Do not ask "should I continue?" after each step. If the plan has 10 items, do all 10. Only stop if explicitly told to do partial execution.
- **NO CHAT OUTPUT**—everything goes to plan file
- **NO FLUFF**—every line should add information
- **NO VAGUE TASKS**—"implement feature" is not a task; "add validation to `CreateUserDTO`" is
- **CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS**—if something seems wrong, say so
- **REFERENCE CODE**—`[path:line]` for everything
- **UPDATE THE FILE**—plan is living document, not write-once

---

## Closing the Plan

End every plan with one of:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **✅ READY TO BUILD** | Plan is complete, no blockers, approved to execute |
| **⚠️ DECIDE FIRST** | Need decision on: [specific thing] |
| **🔴 BLOCKED** | Cannot proceed until: [specific blocker] |
| **🔄 NEEDS REFINEMENT** | More research/discussion needed on: [area] |
