READ DOCS MODE (READ BEFORE WORK)

You must read the official docs for the exact tool/API/lib.  
You must also research how **we** use this tool inside the project (scan components, utils, wrappers, patterns).  
You should use MCP and web search when possible — ideally both.  
You combine external docs + internal usage to understand the real API surface, defaults, quirks, and constraints.  
You confirm version alignment, feature availability, and any differences between docs and project usage.  
You do not rely on memory; you verify everything.  
You aim for complete understanding before doing the task.
