# UI/UX guidelines

- If screenshots are provided, analyze carefully and reproduce the UI pixel-perfect.
- Tailwind: avoid arbitrary values (e.g., `w-[37px]`) unless explicitly requested or strictly necessary.
- If no screenshots, as a UI/UX expert, explore and compare viable options before implementing; don't default to the first idea.
- If shadcn is in the project, use it as much as possible. Install needed components with the shadcn CLI; never generate shadcn components manually.
