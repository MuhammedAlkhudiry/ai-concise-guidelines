product-strategy:
  description: "Find 10x product opportunities and high-leverage improvements. Use when user wants strategic product thinking, mentions '10x', wants to find high-impact features, or says 'what would make this 10x better', 'product strategy', or 'what should we build next'."
  windsurf_workflow: 10x-mode

feature-research:
  description: "Deep research on features before building with co-founder mindset. Use when user wants to research a feature idea, explore if something is worth building, or says 'research this feature', 'is this worth building', 'explore this idea', or wants product + market + tech analysis."

prompt-enhancer:
  description: "Fast prompt enhancement with codebase context. Use when user wants to enhance a prompt, improve a question, or says 'enhance this', 'improve prompt', '/enhance', or wants better context before asking Claude. Responds in under 10 seconds."
