- **SOLO** — Never start dev servers directly; use Solo MCP only, and save any dev URL in `AGENTS.md`.
- **CONSISTENCY** — Reuse existing patterns, files, and functions first; avoid new patterns unless approved.
- **COMPATIBILITY** — Update code directly by default; add BC only when an inter-system contract requires it.
- **COMMENTS** — Keep comments tied to current code only; remove stale or removed comments.
- **STRUCTURE** — Confirm the data model before touching data; never assume schema details.
- **QUERY** — Build query strings only with framework/library helpers; never concatenate manually.
- **TRANSLATION** — Translate all user-facing copy naturally and contextually; add missing translations when needed.
- **QUALITY** — Run type-check, lint, format, and relevant tests; fix only task-related issues before finishing.
- **PARALLEL** — Run checks in parallel whenever possible, including test workers and unrelated checks.
- **FIX** — Prefer safe auto-fix commands over read-only checks.
- **HOLISTIC** — Before behavior changes, trace callers, consumers, and tests, then update all impacted parts; do not implement directly.
- **PARALLELIZE** — For independent tasks, use subagents and run in parallel; serialize only tasks with shared state.

- **KNOWLEDGE** — Keep `KNOWLEDGE.md` descriptive with business rules, decisions, constraints, terminology, and gotchas.
