### This is a list of opinionated guidelines/prompt files that I use daily with AI. They have been carefully curated based on the following principles:

1.	Conciseness: The prompts are designed to be brief so that they don't overload the AI context window with unnecessary noise. 	
2.	Specificity: Each guideline targets a particular behavior. Generic instructions (e.g., "be good," "think hard," "follow user prompt") are avoided because it is assumed that the AI is already equipped with common sense.
3.	Targeting High-End Models: Assuming that the AI model is already about 80% effective, these prompts are intended to push it further.
4.	Enhancement, Not Repair: The prompts are meant to enhance the model's capabilities. The belief is that no amount of instructions can fix a fundamentally weak model.
5.	Practicality: These prompts have been collected through real-world interactions with AI, serving as direct feedback to address AI failures.
