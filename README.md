### Opinionated Guidelines for Daily AI Use

This is a list of opinionated guidelines/prompt files that I use daily with AI. They have been carefully curated based on the following principles:

1. The prompts are designed to be brief, avoiding unnecessary noise that could overload the AI context window.
   
2. Each guideline targets a particular behavior. Generic instructions (e.g., "be good," "think hard," "follow user prompt") are avoided, as it is assumed that the AI is already equipped with common sense.

3. Assuming that the AI model is already about 80% effective, these prompts are intended to push it further.

4. The prompts are meant to enhance the model's capabilities. The belief is that no amount of instructions can fix a fundamentally weak model.

5. These prompts have been collected through real-world interactions with AI, serving as direct feedback to address AI failures.
